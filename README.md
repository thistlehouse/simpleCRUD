## A Simple CRUD project

### Simple one-to-many solution

This is my first solution written entirely out of my head. No tutorial was used. Every concept I've learned so far I applied here (it need some fixing, though :smile:).

The reason of this project is to ilustrate knowledge and capability, I'm looking forward to work with software development and am looking for a job. If you landed here, please consider some feedback of how can I improve my coding and skills.

Known:
- ~~Some DRY princeples violated (need fixing).~~
- Data is not valitaded before pushing to the database.
- Data is not checked if it exists before inserting (used unique value, however ID auto incremets regardless, don't know if DBs are supposed to work like this. I don't like to say this... but "It's working" :grin:)
- Tabulation is not the best, readeble, though.

~~Needs implementation:~~ Done...
- ~~Uptade (wip)~~
- ~~Delete~~
