## A Simple CRUD project

### Simple one-to-many solution

This is my first solution written entirely out of my head. No tutorial was used. Every concept I've learned so far I applied here (it need some fixing, though :smile:).

The reason of this project is to ilustrate knowledge and capability, I'm looking forward to work with software development and am looking for a job. If you landed here, please consider some feedback of how can I improve my coding and skills.

Known issues:
- ~~Some DRY princeples violated (need fixing).~~
- Data is not valitaded before pushing to the database.
- Data is not checked if it exists before inserting (used unique value, however ID auto incremets regardless, don't know if DBs are supposed to work like this. I don't like to say this... but "It's working" :grin:)
- Tabulation is not the best, readeble, though.

Needs implementation:
- Uptade (wip)
- Delete

Even though is the first project I've ever made, I'll keep returning to it for improvements and apllying new concepts and techniques but will look forward to new ones, since I need to show my evolution.

If you got till here, thank you for your time and consideration.
